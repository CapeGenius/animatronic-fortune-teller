## Software

Our software contains five parts: an Arduino Serial Port listener, sound player, sound recorder, Whisper Live API, and Google Cloud Natural Language API. Based on the Serial data (which is triggered by a button press), a different sequence of events will activate. 

## Firmware 
Our firmware contains C++ code for the main interaction sequence for the Arduino Uno and the fading lights sequences for the Arduino Nano!
